abstract = {Crack occurrence and propagation are among critical factors that affect the performance and lifespan of civil infrastructures such as bridges, pipelines, and so on. As a consequence, numerous crack detection and characterization techniques have been researched and developed in the past decades in the areas of SHM and non-destructive evaluation (NDE). The significant amount of performed studies and the large number of publications give rise to the need to systematize, condensate, and summarize this enormous effort. The aims of this paper are to summarize the knowledge about cracking and its sources, review both existing and emerging methods for crack detection and characterization, and identify the advantages and challenges for these methods. In general, this paper identifies two sensing approaches (direct and indirect) and two data analysis approaches (model-based and model-free or data-driven) along with a range of associated technologies. The advantages and challenges of each approach and technology are discussed and summarized, and the future research needs are identified. This paper is intended to serve as a reference for researchers who are interested in crack detection and characterization as well as for those who are generally interested in SHM and NDE.

Computer detection of cracks can assist the doctors by flagging suspicious cases for closer examinations and thus improve the timeliness and accuracy. This paper presents the detailed image processing procedure including the grid formation, local thresholding, threshold value interpolation, segmentation using fuzzy index measure, background removal, and morphological filtering for the determination of infestation sites of a crack in X-ray image. The image processing procedure was tested with X-ray images of several types of crack bones. Additional tests and analyses were also performed using the developed algorithm on the X-ray images obtained with different image acquisition parameter. Compared to existing methods, this approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of proposed work. "

And a novel binarization method based on gray intensity wave transformation is also introduced to decrease the impact of non-uniform illumination on cell image. It adaptively classifies the pixel depending on local peak and trough on the gray intensity surface. After the cell image binareized, a strategy called “adjacency searching” is adopted to remove the gate lines. Then the ellipse fitting based on least squares is conducted on the contours of crack segments to get their angles, which are used to connect these segments into the whole crack. The experiment on 5000 cells in one panel had shown that the precision of our system has reached 98.5%, and its false alarm rate is less than 9%, which could meet the application requirements. "

abstract = "The detection of cracks and micro-cracks in materials or structures is an important and non-trivial task. A typical method is optical microscopy, providing a 2D image with the crack showing as a line in the material. The use of 3D-visualisationmethods, such as computed tomography (CT), permits the visualisation of materials as complete 3D volumes. In this case, occuring cracks are locally plane-like structures that can be described as 2D surfaces with a 3D topography. To receive the necessary data, the images of the investigated objects are obtained via X-ray computed tomography, providing a 3D-visualisation of materials at micron-range resolutions. In this article, computed tomography is used to investigate cracks in composite materials such as short-fibre reinforced carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP). The goal of this article is to detect all relevant cracks inside an object in a stable way, reducing the effect of noise. The results show the cracks to be smooth and locally connected, resulting in connected components containing a large number of voxels. For this purpose, a mathematical technique based on the local Radon transform is applied. In order to achieve an improvement in speed, the structure tensor is applied to guess the orientation of the local structure. The aim is to determine cracks and to follow crack growth and evolution to increasing loads. "

abstract = "A novel image transformation is proposed for the automatic detection of crack-like faults on inspected surfaces with “busy” or patterned backgrounds (textured surfaces). The textured background is modeled by the proposed transformation, which consists of the Walsh transformation of a nonlinear function of the image intensity. The algorithm includes three stages: training the system to learn the underlying background textural pattern by using faultless images, obtaining the local difference from the underlying texture for the images to be tested, and postprocessing the difference map to isolate the fault pixels. By this method, crack-like faults in random and regularly textured backgrounds can be detected reliably and efficiently. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on artificially created faults on some Brodatz texture images as well as on some real images of materials with genuine faults on them. "

abstract ={It is well-recognized that civil infrastructure monitoring approaches that rely on visual approaches will continue to be an important methodology for condition assessment of such systems. Current inspection standards for structures such as bridges require an inspector to travel to a target structure site and visually assess the structure's condition. A less time-consuming and inexpensive alternative to current visual monitoring methods is to use a system that could inspect structures remotely and also more frequently. This article presents and evaluates the underlying technical elements for the development of an integrated inspection software tool that is based on the use of inexpensive digital cameras. For this purpose, digital cameras are appropriately mounted on a structure (e.g., a bridge) and can zoom or rotate in three directions (similar to traffic cameras). They are remotely controlled by an inspector, which allows the visual assessment of the structure's condition by looking at images captured by the cameras. By not having to travel to the structure's site, other issues related to safety considerations and traffic detouring are consequently bypassed. The proposed system gives an inspector the ability to compare the current (visual) situation of a structure with its former condition. If an inspector notices a defect in the current view, he/she can request a reconstruction of the same view using images that were previously captured and automatically stored in a database. Furthermore, by generating databases that consist of periodically captured images of a structure, the proposed system allows an inspector to evaluate the evolution of changes by simultaneously comparing the structure's condition at different time periods. The essential components of the proposed virtual image reconstruction system are: keypoint detection, keypoint matching, image selection, outlier exclusion, bundle adjustment, composition, and cropping. Several illustrative examples are presented in this article to demonstrate the capabilities, as well as the limitations, of the proposed vision-based inspection procedure.},

abstract = "Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graphs are useful for organizing classifiers and visualizing their performance. \{ROC\} graphs are commonly used in medical decision making, and in recent years have been used increasingly in machine learning and data mining research. Although \{ROC\} graphs are apparently simple, there are some common misconceptions and pitfalls when using them in practice. The purpose of this article is to serve as an introduction to \{ROC\} graphs and as a guide for using them in research. "
